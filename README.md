# Cricket-Game
This is basic 20-20 cricket game using Turbo C++

*Note: This code works only on Turbo C++ environment*
## Dependencies
Make sure Graphics.h is imported, that is the key library in the entire project.

A good ram is also needed xD as it buffers elsewise.
Just click Ctrl+F9 and it works like a charm:")
